WebCV by Daria T.

Hello dear reader!

This CV has been created by Daria T. to showcase my skills in frontend development, design, animation, and more. Here, you will learn about:

*Frontend skills.*  
*Design expertise.*  
*Animation techniques.*  
*Marketing knowledge.*  
*Sales experience.*  
**And how I combine all of these skills into one individual.**

To build this webCV, I used TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL for visitor data collection, and a lot of animations to bring the experience to life.

Feel free to explore and enjoy learning more about me!
